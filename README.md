Description:
This is a semi-automatic tool for sleep analysis based on data from EEG/EMG recording.

Principle:
Distinguish different brain states including NREM sleep, REM sleep and wakefulness based on EMG and power spectrum of EEG.

Function:
Batch read EEG/EMG recording data in DAQ files,
Visualization EMG signals for data quality control,
Filter EEG and EMG signals,
Calculate power spectrum of EEG,
Distinguish different brain states and analyze their duration and transition,
and finally output organized results in Excel files.
Optionally, compare results of automatic and manual analysis.

Contribution:
Mingcan Yu designed, developed and improved this toolbox.
Junying Wang tested it with experimental data, checked its results with her manual analysis and provided the feedback.
